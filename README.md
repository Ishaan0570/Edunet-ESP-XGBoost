# Edunet-ESP-XGBoost
# Employee Salary Prediction (ML Project)

This machine learning project predicts whether an individual's income exceeds \$50,000 per year using demographic and employment data from the UCI Adult dataset. The workflow includes data cleaning, outlier handling, feature encoding, and training multiple classification models.

### Key Steps:
- Preprocessed data (handled missing values, removed outliers, label encoded)
- Trained models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, Gradient Boosting
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy scores
- Saved the best-performing model for future use

### Tools & Libraries:
Python, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, joblib

### Outcome:
A reliable income classification model with strong predictive accuracy, ready for integration or future expansion.
